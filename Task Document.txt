Data Collection Mechanism
1. Create a Robot that can autonomously go in circles
2. Create Camera2Image functionality
3. Creat 6 camera perspective attached to robot
4. 6 Camera perspective should be triggered to capture images when "Player" is in scene
==============================
Scene Design
1. Create Sexually suggestive animations 
2. Position "Players" in various poses (leveraging animations)

=============================
Additional Notes:

-We need to decide on URP or HDRP pipeline. I think URP will be good, but it will be dependent on the assets we want to use. 
Therefore, further exploration of the Unity Asset store to finalize the identfied assets we will be using for characters ("Player") and environement.

-The goal of this design is to automate the data collection process with an autonmous virtual robot that has 6 cameras on it for varing angles.
We will have a scene with both consenual and non-consenual animations running simultaneously. This scene will then be used to create our dataset.
